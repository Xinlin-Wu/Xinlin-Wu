### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 - Iâ€™m currently a senior student of Kuangyaming Hornor School, Nanjing University. My major is Math and Applied Math. I am mainly interested in analysis
of partial differential equations. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning the second order parabolic differential equations. Next term, I am going to learn second order elliptic differential equations and some 
basic knowledge of nonlinear analysis.
- How to reach me: Although my primary email is 1139398758@qq.com in this account, I am now mainly using 191240059@smail.nju.edu.cn
- Attached materials are my CV and some dissertations I have written.
