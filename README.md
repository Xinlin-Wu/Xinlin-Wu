### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently a senior student of Kuangyaming Hornor School, Nanjing University. My major is Math and Applied Math. I am mainly interested in analysis
of partial differential equations. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the second order parabolic differential equations. Next term, I am going to learn second order elliptic differential equations and some 
basic knowledge of nonlinear analysis.
- 📫 How to reach me: Although my primary email is 1139398758@qq.com in this account, I am now mainly using 191240059@smail.nju.edu.cn\\
-🔭 Attached materials are my CV and some dissertations I have written.
